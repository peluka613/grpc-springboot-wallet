# grpc-springboot-wallet

## Requirements
The task consists of a wallet server and a wallet client. 
The wallet server will keep track of a users monetary balance in the system. 
There should be separate balance for different currencies.
The client will emulate users depositing and withdrawing funds.

## Database
Must include the database schema that is needed for the server application.

## Technologies
### The following technologies must be used
    • Java 8+ 
    • Spring 5.x
    • gRPC
    • MySQL 5.x
    • Gradle
    • JUnit
### Extra points for using these technologies:
    • Docker
    • Hibernate
    • Spring Boot 2.x

## Wallet Server
The wallet server must expose the interface described below via gRPC.
Interfaces

### Deposit
Deposit funds to the users wallet.

Input
    • User id
    • Amount
    • Currency (allowed values are EUR, USD, GBP)
Output
    • No output needed
Errors
    • Unknown currency

### Withdraw
Withdraw funds from the user wallet.

Input
    • User id
    • Amount
    • Currency (allowed values are EUR, USD, GBP)
Output
    • No output needed
Errors
    • Unknown currency, insufficient funds

### Balance
Get the users current balance.
Input
    • User id
Output
    • The balance of the users account for each currency

### Integration Test
    1. Make a withdrawal of USD 200 for user with id 1. Must return "insufficient_funds".
    2. Make a deposit of USD 100 to user with id 1.
    3. Check that all balances are correct
    4. Make a withdrawal of USD 200 for user with id 1. Must return "insufficient_funds".
    5. Make a deposit of EUR 100 to user with id 1.
    6. Check that all balances are correct
    7. Make a withdrawal of USD 200 for user with id 1. Must return "insufficient_funds".
    8. Make a deposit of USD 100 to user with id 1.
    9. Check that all balances are correct
    10. Make a withdrawal of USD 200 for user with id 1. Must return "ok".
    11. Check that all balances are correct
    12. Make a withdrawal of USD 200 for user with id 1. Must return "insufficient_funds".


## Wallet Client
The wallet client will emulate a number of users concurrently using the wallet. 
The wallet client must connect to the wallet server over gRPC. 
The client eliminating users doing rounds (a sequence of events). Whenever a round is needed it is picked at random from the following list of available rounds

- Round A
    • Deposit 100 USD
    • Withdraw 200 USD
    • Deposit 100 EUR
    • Get Balance
    • Withdraw 100 USD
    • Get Balance
    • Withdraw 100 USD
- Round B
    • Withdraw 100 GBP
    • Deposit 300 GPB
    • Withdraw 100 GBP
    • Withdraw 100 GBP
    • Withdraw 100 GBP
- Round C
    • Get Balance
    • Deposit 100 USD
    • Deposit 100 USD
    • Withdraw 100 USD
    • Depsoit 100 USD
    • Get Balance
    • Withdraw 200 USD
    • Get Balance

## The wallet client CLI parameters
    1. Users (number of concurrent users emulated)
    2. Concurrent_threads_per_user (number of concurrent requests a user will make)
    3. Rounds_per_thread (number of rounds each thread is executing)
Make sure the client exits when all rounds has been executed.
Reporting
Together with your source code please include the following:
    • Instructions on how to run the client and the server
    • Explanation of important choices in your solution
    • Estimate on how many transactions your wallet can handle per second on your development machine (and an explanation on how you reached that number)
